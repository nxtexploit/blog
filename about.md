Hello <img src="https://i.imgur.com/fZPfuNV.gif" width="20px">, I'm Aziz, a penetration tester with a robust background in Web, Mobile, and network pentesting, as well as Red Teaming. Over the past 2 years, I have identified security flaws in various companies through VDPs as well as bug bounty programs.
