Hello Bug Hunters,

Hope your bountiesðŸ’¸ are treating you well. Recently, I opened a bank account with SBI (I usually prefer private banks, but needed this for specific reasons). Like many government banks, they pushed additional add-ons â€” insurance and a demat account. Not knowing these weren't mandatory, I declined insurance but agreed to open a demat account.

The next day, I received my credentials via email and logged into my demat account. While exploring the platform, I noticed an interesting feature. Although I typically avoid testing assets that don't offer rewards (no money, no bugs), I figured this would only take 5 minutes to test.

In this write-up, I'll disclose a critical security flaw I discovered in SBI Bank's system that allowed me to check anyone's bank account balance using just their phone number and account number. (doesn't need to have a demat account)



### Vulnerability Overview:

The vulnerability was an **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)** in the "Get Balance" feature of the SBI Securities demat account portal. By manipulating the `AccountNo` parameter, I could retrieve the account balance of any SBI bank account. (doesn't need to have a demat account)

### Attack Prerequisites:

Getting Account details(Account Number): 


#### **Step 1:** Obtaining Account Details:(still works)

The main challenge was obtaining the victim's account number. From an attacker's perspective, bank account numbers aren't publicly available. However, I discovered that **NSDL Payments Bank** displays the receiver's complete account details in transaction statements â€” including account number, IFSC code, and name â€” when you send money via phone number or UPI ID.

#### **Step 2:** Exploiting the IDOR Vulnerability to Obtain the Account Balance:

After logging into my demat account, I found a feature called "Get Balance" that fetches the bank account balance linked to the demat account. This feature had a critical flaw.

The request contained a `POST` parameter `&AccountNo=1234567890` that was vulnerable to IDOR. By replacing my account number with the victim's account number, the response revealed:

The victim's Account Balance & Account type `(S=Savings, C=Current)`

```

The response format `"S|5407.19"` indicates:
